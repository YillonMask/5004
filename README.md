This course explores the ideas and rationale underlying Object Oriented Design (OOD). We will use the Java programming language to exercise key concepts and best practices that support the creation of large-scale, reusable, extensible, robust software. The key concepts include:

* Information Hiding
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance (and Composition/Delegation)
* Polymorphism\
The best practices include:

Avoiding redundant code
Separating information about specifications from details of implementation\
Use of Javadocs and code commentary to thoroughly document programs\
Test-driven approach to development\
Adherence to typical industry-standard style guidelines\
